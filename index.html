    <p>Fruits are important sources of vitamins and carbohydrates like fiber and sugar. They are low in calories and naturally sweet. 
        Fruits and their juices are good sources of water, too. Different fruits contain different vitamins, so it is important to eat
        a variety of fruits.Fruit is the sweet, fleshy, edible part of a plant. It generally contains seeds. Fruits are usually eaten raw,
        although some varieties can be cooked. They come in a wide variety of colours, shapes and flavours.</p>
    
    <p>The word fruit itself can be traced back to the Latin word <b> “fructus” </b> derived from “frui” which means to enjoy or delight.</p>
